🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Arbitrum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using Rust, NextJS, RainbowKit, Stylus, Wagmi, Viem, and TypeScript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://arb-stylus.github.io/scaffold-stylus-docs/components)**: Collection of React hooks wrapped around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with TypeScript autocompletion.
- 🧱 [**Components**](https://arb-stylus.github.io/scaffold-stylus-docs/hooks): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Arbitrum network.

# DeFi-Project-ERC20-scaffold-stylus - Jim Soria Rivera

This project implements a dApp and an ERC-20 token.

## dApp shows Address owner wallet, balances and the EXRP USD price that simulates the XRP real token

# First Part:

1. Installation of the ERC-20 extensions located in: "https://www.scaffoldstylus.com".
2. Creation of the project in my local pc as "DeFi-Project-ERC20-scaffold-stylus".
3. Uploading GitHub: "https://github.com/autodidacttrade/DeFi-Project-ERC20-scaffold-stylus".
4. Installation of the Hardhat 2.0, JavaScript and libraries like OpenZepellin to create a ERC-20 Smart Contract.
5. Creation of the file ETHXRP.sol to create the ERC-20.
6. Creation of the file .env to setup the environment variables.
7. Implementation of the file hardhat.config.js to call the environment parameters.
8. Creation of the file deploy.js to deploy the ERC-20 contract in the blockchain.
9. Verification of the contract in Sepolia Testnet with the Etherscan: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8F423758Ac39B6962CB052c819d5F1761768fCb2"
10. Addition of the contract address in my MetaMask/Rabby wallet to import the token EXRP 

# Second Part:

11. Creation of the node to read and replicate the XRP price, and installation of the library "express".
12. Verification the deploying of my wallet/contract in Etherscan because I had problems to import the ERC-20 token in my MetaMask wallet, so I imported the tokens in Rabby Wallet: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x8f423758ac39b6962cb052c819d5f1761768fcb2?a=0x8181ac4ee632dd0a9ce9380b07a8842b18001702".
13. Creation of the Front-End to connect a wallet, it shows the information wallet and the XRP prices replicated in EXRP token, this part has the creation of two files: server.js (back-end) and connect_wallet.html (front-end).
14. Creation of the Mint with a implementation of back-end to mint more tokens within the main owner wallet deployed.
15. Several attempts to deploy my Front-End in Vercel but I couldn't.
16. My solution was just deployed the most important files of my front-end and back-end in my personal vps: "http://161.132.55.153:3000".
17. Setup of the RPC Node, .env, hardhat.config.js and deploy ERC-20 Smart Contract in Arbitrum Sepolia: "https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x7EB53A531F2029a580ED285f53dE48447B02b168".
18. Started the back-end and front-end dApp from "http://161.132.55.153:3000".
